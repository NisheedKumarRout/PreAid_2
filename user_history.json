      "advice": "## First Aid for a Nosebleed:\n\n**1. Stay Calm and Sit Upright:**  Leaning forward is crucial.  Tilting your head back can cause blood to run down your throat, which can be uncomfortable and potentially lead to swallowing blood.\n\n**2. Pinch Your Nose:** Gently pinch the soft part of your nose (just below the bony bridge) between your thumb and forefinger.  Pinch firmly and continuously for at least 10 minutes.  Do not release to check frequently; this can interrupt clotting.\n\n**3. Breathe Through Your Mouth:**  Keep breathing calmly through your mouth.\n\n**4. Apply Cold Compress:** While pinching your nose, apply a cold compress (ice pack wrapped in a cloth) to the bridge of your nose.  The cold helps constrict blood vessels.\n\n**5. After 10 Minutes:**  Gently release your pinch. If the bleeding stops, continue to apply the cold compress for another 10-15 minutes.\n\n**6. Avoid Blowing Your Nose:**  Avoid blowing your nose for at least several hours as this can dislodge any clots that have formed.\n\n**7. When to Seek Medical Attention:**\n\n* **Bleeding lasts longer than 20 minutes despite first aid.**\n* **Bleeding is severe (soaking through multiple tissues).**\n* **You have difficulty breathing.**\n* **The nosebleed follows a head injury.**\n* **You are taking blood thinners.**\n* **You have a known bleeding disorder.**\n* **The nosebleed is recurrent or unexplained.**\n* **You have other concerning symptoms, such as dizziness, weakness, or fainting.**\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Do not put anything up your nose** (cotton, tissue, etc.) to try and stop the bleeding. This can push the clot out and prolong the bleeding.\n* **Do not tilt your head back.**\n* **If you are unsure about anything, seek medical advice.**  This information is for guidance only and does not replace professional medical care.\n\nThis information is for general knowledge and does not constitute medical advice.  Always consult a healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.\n",

      "advice": "It's important to preface this by saying I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.  The information below is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not substitute for professional medical advice.  **If the headache is severe, sudden, or accompanied by other concerning symptoms, seek immediate medical attention.**\n\nA headache following a nosebleed could be coincidental, or it could be related.  Let's consider some possibilities:\n\n**Possible Causes of Headache after a Nosebleed:**\n\n* **Dehydration:**  Significant blood loss from a nosebleed can lead to dehydration, which can trigger headaches.\n* **Strain:**  Holding your head in an awkward position to control the nosebleed, or straining during the episode itself, can cause a tension headache.\n* **Medication Side Effects:**  If medication was used to stop the nosebleed (e.g., a nasal decongestant), it could be causing a headache as a side effect.\n* **Underlying Condition:**  Both nosebleeds and headaches can be symptoms of underlying conditions like high blood pressure, a brain tumor (though this is less likely given the context), or a blood clotting disorder.  Recurring nosebleeds and headaches warrant medical investigation.\n* **Sinusitis:**  If the nosebleed was related to sinusitis (inflammation of the sinuses), the sinus pressure could be contributing to the headache.\n\n**First Aid for the Headache (assuming it's mild to moderate):**\n\n* **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water to rule out dehydration as a cause.\n* **Rest:** Lie down in a quiet, dark room.\n* **Over-the-Counter Pain Relief:**  Consider taking an over-the-counter pain reliever like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) following the package instructions.  **Do not take aspirin if you suspect a bleeding disorder.**\n* **Cold Compress:** Applying a cool, damp cloth to your forehead may help alleviate the pain.\n* **Avoid Triggers:** Identify and avoid potential headache triggers such as stress, caffeine, or certain foods.\n\n**When to Seek Medical Attention:**\n\n* **Severe headache:**  A sudden, severe headache, especially if it's the worst headache of your life.\n* **Headache accompanied by:** Fever, stiff neck, confusion, vision changes, numbness or weakness, seizures, difficulty speaking, or loss of consciousness.\n* **Recurring",
